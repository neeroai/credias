# CrediAS - Credit Assessment System

A comprehensive credit assessment system built with BMad Method AI-assisted development.

## Project Overview

CrediAS is a modern credit assessment platform that leverages AI-driven development methodologies to deliver robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions for credit evaluation and risk management.

## BMad Method Integration

This project uses the **BMad Method** (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development) framework for structured, AI-assisted development.

### Quick Start with BMad Agents

```bash
# Start market research and planning
/analyst    # Market research and competitive analysis
/pm         # Product requirements and strategy
/architect  # System design and architecture

# Development workflow
/sm         # Create and manage stories
/dev        # Implement features with TDD
/qa         # Code review and quality assurance

# Design and user experience
/ux-expert  # UI/UX design and prototyping
/po         # Backlog management and refinement
```

### Available Commands

- `/help` - Show all available BMad agents
- Each agent has specific `*help` commands for their capabilities

```

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (Use Web UI or IDE)
1. **Market Research**: Use `/analyst` for competitive analysis
2. **Product Planning**: Use `/pm` to create PRD
3. **Architecture Design**: Use `/architect` for system design
4. **UX Design**: Use `/ux-expert` for interface design

### Phase 2: Development (Use IDE)
1. **Story Creation**: Use `/sm` to create development stories
2. **Implementation**: Use `/dev` for TDD-based development
3. **Quality Assurance**: Use `/qa` for code review
4. **Story Management**: Use `/po` for backlog refinement

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start with Planning**:
   ```bash
   # Use any BMad agent to begin
   /analyst    # For market research
   /pm         # For product planning
   ```

3. **Begin Development**:
   ```bash
   /sm         # Create your first story
   /dev        # Implement the story
   ```

## Features

- AI-assisted development with specialized agents
- Test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Comprehensive code review process
- Structured story management
- Integrated design system
- Quality assurance automation

## Technology Stack

*To be defined during architecture phase*

## Contributing

This project follows BMad Method development practices:

1. All changes should be story-driven
2. Test-driven development is mandatory
3. Code reviews are required for all implementations
4. Documentation should be maintained alongside code

## Support

- Use `/help` to see all available BMad agents
- Each agent provides specialized assistance for their domain
- Check `docs/` directory for detailed documentation
