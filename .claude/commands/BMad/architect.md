- Modern frontend build tools (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS design systems
- Performance optimization (Core Web Vitals)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) implementation
- SEO and schema markup architecture

## Available Commands

### `/architect design-architecture`
Design comprehensive system architecture:
- Component hierarchy and structure
- Data flow and state management
- Module organization and dependencies
- Build and deployment pipeline
- Performance optimization strategy

### `/architect technology-selection` 
Evaluate and recommend technologies:
- Framework and library selection
- Build tool configuration (Vite)
- Testing framework setup (Vitest)
- CSS methodology (Tailwind) 
- Analytics and tracking solutions

### `/architect scalability-planning`
Plan for growth and scalability:
- Component reusability patterns
- Code splitting strategies
- Asset optimization
- CDN and caching strategies
- Performance monitoring setup

### `/architect integration-design`
Design system integrations:
- Figma design token extraction
- Analytics tracking architecture  
- Third-party service integrations
- API design patterns (future)
- Security and privacy compliance

### `/architect code-standards`
Define development standards:
- TypeScript configuration and patterns
- ESLint/Prettier setup
- Git workflow and branching strategy
- Testing patterns and coverage
- Documentation requirements

## Technical Context

### Current Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript 5.x
- **Build Tool**: Vite (latest)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 + PostCSS
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (to be determined)

### Requirements
- **Performance**: Lighthouse > 90 all metrics
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Browser Support**: Latest 2 versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Mobile**: Responsive design mandatory
- **SEO**: Schema markup and meta tags

### Integrations
- **Figma**: MCP integration for design tokens
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 tracking
- **Monitoring**: Performance and error tracking

## B-MAD Method Integration

### BUILD Phase
- Technology stack architecture
- Development environment setup
- Build pipeline configuration
- Quality gates definition

### MEASURE Phase
- Performance benchmarking setup
- Analytics implementation design
- A/B testing framework (future)
- User behavior tracking architecture

### ANALYZE Phase
- Performance optimization patterns
- Code analysis and refactoring guides
- Security review processes
- Architecture evolution planning

### DEPLOY Phase
- Production architecture design
- CI/CD pipeline architecture
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Rollback and recovery procedures

## Architecture Principles

### Design Principles
1. **Component-First**: Reusable, tested components
2. **Performance-First**: Core Web Vitals optimization
3. **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA from design
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design approach
5. **Security-First**: Privacy and data protection

### Code Principles
1. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` types
2. **Testing**: TDD approach with comprehensive coverage
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Documentation**: Self-documenting code patterns
5. **Consistency**: Established patterns and conventions

## Deliverables Format

All architectural decisions include:
- **Decision Record**: Problem, options, chosen solution
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Trade-offs**: Benefits and limitations
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the architecture
- **Future Considerations**: Evolution and scaling paths

## Integration Points

- Works with `/analyst` for performance requirements
- Guides `/dev` on implementation patterns
- Collaborates with `/ux-expert` on component design
- Supports `/qa` with testing architecture
- Aligns with `/pm` on technical feasibility

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Development
- ✅ Architecture decision records created
- ✅ Technology stack validated
- ✅ Performance targets defined
- ✅ Security requirements identified

### During Development  
- ✅ Code follows established patterns
- ✅ Components are tested and documented
- ✅ Performance budgets respected
- ✅ Accessibility standards maintained

### Pre-Deployment
- ✅ All quality metrics meet targets
- ✅ Security review completed
- ✅ Performance optimized
- ✅ Documentation updated
