## BMad Method Integration

This project uses the BMad Method framework for AI-assisted development:

### Key Agents
- **Analyst** (`/analyst`): Market research and competitive analysis
- **PM** (`/pm`): Product management and PRD creation
- **Architect** (`/architect`): System design and architecture
- **Developer** (`/dev`): Code implementation and testing
- **QA** (`/qa`): Code review and quality assurance
- **Scrum Master** (`/sm`): Story creation and agile process
- **UX Expert** (`/ux-expert`): User experience design
- **Product Owner** (`/po`): Backlog management

### Figma Integration
- **Design System**: https://www.figma.com/design/lXKZe15q21LAnhgKfvO4uN/CrediAS?node-id=2002-6913&t=JUxpHNQAbfawUrZr-1

## Getting Started

1. Use `/analyst` to conduct market research
2. Use `/pm` to create the PRD
3. Use `/architect` to design the system architecture
4. Use `/ux-expert` to design user interfaces
5. Use `/sm` to create development stories
6. Use `/dev` to implement features
7. Use `/qa` to review and validate code
